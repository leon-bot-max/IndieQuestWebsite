    <h2>Learn indie game development</h2>
    <p>
      The Indie Quest is a course in programming, art, and production, specifically designed for creating indie games.
      Instead of studying individual subjects in isolation, you acquire the skills directly by using them on game
      projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will first become an apprentice, completing carefully designed game coding missions that will build your
      programming knowledge step-by-step. You will then extend these foundations by learning advanced concepts while
      creating your own games. Applying project management strategies will help you prototype your ideas and polish the
      end result to share your games with the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the art side of things you will choose any visual style that you want for your games. A study plan personalized
      for your goals will guide you through the art fundamentals and technical aspects required to bring your vision to
      life. Be it pixel art, 3D, traditional drawing, or digital painting, we have you covered.

    <h2>The way we teach</h2>
    <p>
      There are no exams in our school. You will not have to write project reports or memorize theory. All that matters
      is what you are able to create and your completed games will demonstrate that.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use the flipped classroom model to make sure you get all the help you need to master your skills. Instead of
      listening to a teacher lecturing everyone at the same speed, you will use online educational materials to learn at
      your own pace. Some concepts might take longer to conquer, other times you will breeze ahead. The teacher will be
      there to answer any specific questions and help you individually when you need it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will share an office space with other students and a teacher so you can learn and create in a supportive
      environment. Daily stand-up meetings will kick off the workday and weekly group check-ins will make sure everyone
      is reaching their goals.
    </p>

    <h2>More than a school</h2>
    <p>
      Another unique advantage of The Indie Quest, besides the specialized curriculum, is learning and working within a
      community of many professional indie game developers. Spelkollektivet, where the school takes place, is the
      largest co-living and co-working space for game developers from all over the world. You will be part of a
      friendly, supportive community that shares the love for gaming and creating games, including all the social and
      professional development activities that happen in the house.
